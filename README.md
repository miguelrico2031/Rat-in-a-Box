In Rat in a Box, you play as Maxwell, a college science student who is taking an internship with a mysterious scientist. Your task is to conduct experiments involving a rat in a box, which you must guide to a button using stimuli, both visual and olfactory, provided by various objects.

The rat is “rewarded” upon reaching and pressing the button, but Maxwell soon notices that something is wrong as the experiments become increasingly strange and cruel. Will Maxwell get to the bottom of the matter? Well, that depends on whether you, the player, can solve all the puzzles! It's up to you.
